    <h1>Each moment the world is changing, or one would say in this information age, updating itself. Each update is governed by actors and creating either new and relevant stories or becoming a part of eternal ones. The actors, actions, places, contexts, reasons and the stories are at one level, merely dots in this stream of updates. The Grid is an effort to try out methods of viewing the dots and connecting them.</h1>
